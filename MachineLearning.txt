Here's a concise Machine Learning Cheat Sheet covering key concepts, algorithms, and metrics:

1. Types of Machine Learning
    Supervised Learning: Learn from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
    Unsupervised Learning: Learn from unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
    Reinforcement Learning: Learn by interacting with an environment (e.g., game AI, robotics).

2. Common Algorithms
    Supervised Learning
        Regression:
            Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes.
            Ridge/Lasso Regression: Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
        Classification:
            Logistic Regression: Binary classification.
            Decision Trees: Splits data into decision nodes.
            Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees.
            Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds hyperplanes for classification.
            K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on the nearest neighbors.
            Naive Bayes: Uses Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
            Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM): Ensemble method improving weak learners.

    Unsupervised Learning
        Clustering:

            K-Means: Groups data into K clusters.
            Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters.
            DBSCAN: Density-based clustering.

    Dimensionality Reduction:

        PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality by orthogonal transformation.
        t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Visualizes high-dimensional data.

3. Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
    Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): Basic architecture of neural networks.
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): For image classification.
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): For sequential data like time series.
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Handles long-range dependencies.
    GRU (Gated Recurrent Units): A simplified version of LSTM.
    Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
    Autoencoders: Neural network for unsupervised learning (compression).
    
4. Model Evaluation Metrics
    Regression:
        Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between actual and predicted values.
        Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE.
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences.
        R-Squared (RÂ²): Proportion of variance explained by the model.
    Classification:
        Accuracy: Proportion of correctly predicted labels.
        Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives).
        Recall (Sensitivity): True positives / (True positives + False negatives).
        F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
        ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve): Performance metric for classification models at various threshold settings.

5. Data Preprocessing Techniques
    Normalization: Scaling features to a [0, 1] range.
    Standardization: Scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance.
    One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical variables into binary vectors.
    Label Encoding: Converts categorical labels into integer values.
    Handling Missing Data: Imputation (mean, median, mode) or dropping rows/columns.

6. Model Validation Techniques
    Train-Test Split: Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20).
    K-Fold Cross-Validation: Splits data into K subsets and validates over all subsets.
    Stratified Cross-Validation: Ensures class distribution is preserved in each fold.

7. Bias-Variance Tradeoff
    Bias: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions (underfitting).
    Variance: Error due to model sensitivity to small data changes (overfitting).
    Goal: Find a balance to avoid underfitting and overfitting.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning
    Grid Search: Exhaustively search over specified hyperparameter values.
    Random Search: Random combinations of hyperparameters.
    Bayesian Optimization: Smart search based on previous results.

9. Common Data Sets
    Classification: CIFAR-10, MNIST, ImageNet, Iris.
    Regression: Boston Housing, California Housing.
    Clustering: Titanic dataset (for binary classification too).

10. Popular ML Libraries
    Python:
    scikit-learn: General ML algorithms.
    TensorFlow: Deep learning framework.
    Keras: User-friendly neural network library.
    PyTorch: Deep learning framework with dynamic computation graph.
    XGBoost: Optimized gradient boosting library.
